title: "(In Progress) Air Traffic Segmentation Contrastive Coding: A Contrastive Representation Learning Framework for Air Traffic Trajectory Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/trajclr2
excerpt: This research is the ongoing extension for the previous paper. We propose a contrastive representation learning framework dedicated for air traffic trajectory data. 
  The proposed framework is based on the hypothesis that the air traffic trajectory data can be segmented into several segments. 
  The representation in each segment are maximized to be similar to each other and dissimilar to the representation in other segments, preserving the temporal dynamics of the trajectory data.
