title: "Flight Delay Prediction via Cross-Modality Adaptation of Large Language Models and Aircraft Trajectory Representation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/llmxdelay
excerpt: #'This paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information, including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace conditions.'
