I am currently pursuing my doctoral degree at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in South Korea, where I am part of the Laboratory for Information and Control Systems (LiCS) under the expert guidance of Prof. Han-Lim Choi.

My work at LiCS is primarily about time series representation learning, with a focus on the trajectories of moving objects. 
Given the emphasis on core machine learning at LiCS, I have a keen interest in self-supervised learning, representation learning (particularly through contrastive learning), and their scientific applications. 
In terms of applied machine learning, my current project is centered on aerospace data applications, namely the study of representation learning for air traffic control data and its multimodal aspects. 
The air traffic trajectory data is time series data and procedural language at the same time, and the air traffic controller would rather interpret the trajectory in a semantic sense, not a physical sense. 
Representation learning plays a significant role in semantically capturing the meaning of the trajectory data as the air traffic controller does. 
However, my interests are not limited to the aerospace domain, for I believe that the frameworks in core machine learning research can contribute across various scientific fields.

Prior to my time at KAIST, I was an undergraduate student at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) in Thailand. 
There, I joined the Air-Space Control, Optimization, and Management Laboratory (ASCOM-LAB) under the supervision of Asst. Prof. Dr. Patcharin Kamsing. 
During my undergraduate time, my thesis was on vision-based spacecraft pose estimation for non-cooperative docking operations, exploring the intersection of machine learning and aerospace navigation. 
I also worked on simulating spacecraft kinematics during my internship period at the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT).

Before coming to KAIST, I was part of an entrepreneurial endeavor linked to ASCOM-LAB. 
As an aerospace engineer at Satang Space Company Limited, a spin-off from ASCOM-LAB, I contributed to a part of the space situational awareness (SSA) system. 
This system incorporates data-driven risk assessment techniques using machine learning to evaluate potential collisions.
