I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in South Korea, where I am part of the Laboratory for Information and Control Systems (LiCS) under the expert guidance of Prof. Choi Han-Lim. 

My work at LiCS primarily about time series representation learning, with a focus on the trajectories of moving objects. 
Given the emphasis on core machine learning at LiCS, I have a keen interest in self-supervised learning, representation learning (particularly through contrastive learning), and their scientific applications.
In terms of applied machine learning, my current project is centered on aerospace data applications, namely the study on representation learning for air traffic control data and its multimodal aspects. 
However, my interests are not limited to the aerospace domain, for I believe that the frameworks in core machine learning research can contribute across various scientific fields.

Prior to my time at KAIST, I was an undergraduate student at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) in Thailand. 
There, I joined the Air-Space Control, Optimization, and Management Laboratory (ASCOM-LAB) under the supervision of Asst. Prof. Dr. Patcharin Kamsing. 
The lab's focus on navigation, guidance, control, and aerospace data application aligned well with my interests. 
During my undergraduate studies, my thesis centered on vision-based spacecraft pose estimation for non-cooperative docking operations, exploring the intersection of data mining and aerospace engineering.

Additionally, I gained valuable experience as a research intern at the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT), where my work involved simulating spacecraft kinematics and dynamics.
Before embarking on my journey at KAIST, I was part of an entrepreneurial endeavor linked to ASCOM-LAB. 
As an aerospace engineer at Satang Space Company Limited, a spin-off from ASCOM-LAB, I contributed to the development of a space situational awareness (SSA) system. 
This system not only monitors space objects and predicts collision risks but also incorporates data-driven risk assessment techniques using machine learning to evaluate potential collisions.
